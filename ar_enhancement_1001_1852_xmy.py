AR Enhancement Program

This program demonstrates how to use the Requests framework to interact with an AR (Augmented Reality) service.
It sends a request to an AR service endpoint, retrieves augmented data, and processes it accordingly.

Attributes:
    ar_service_url (str): The URL of the AR service endpoint.

Methods:
    get_ar_data(image_path): Sends a request to the AR service with an image and retrieves augmented data.
    process_ar_data(data): Processes the augmented data received from the AR service.
"""

# Define the AR service URL
ar_service_url = "https://example-ar-service.com/api/ar"

    Returns:
        dict: The augmented data received from the AR service.
    
    Raises:
        requests.RequestException: If there is an issue with the request.
